## 📝 Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory (or use `.env.example` as a template):

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://qrs_user:qrs_password@localhost:5432/qrs_db"

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production"

# Next.js
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Environment Variables Explained

- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string for Prisma
- **JWT_SECRET**: Secret key for signing JWT tokens (change in production!)
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL**: Public URL for the application
- **NODE_ENV**: Environment mode (development/production)

### Vercel Environment Variables
- Vercel does **not** use `.env` files from your repo for security reasons.
- Instead, add environment variables in the Vercel dashboard (or with `vercel env` CLI) using the same keys as above.
- Keep `.env.example` in your repo to document required variables for all environments.

## 🔐 Authentication API

### Signup
```bash
POST /api/auth/signup
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "user_id",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "userType": "COMMON",
    "isActive": true,
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "token": "jwt_token_here"
}
```

### Login
```bash
POST /api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "user_id",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "userType": "COMMON",
    "isActive": true
  },
  "token": "jwt_token_here"
}
```

### Error Responses
Both endpoints return error responses in this format:
```json
{
  "error": "Error message here"
}
```

### Token Verification
```bash
POST /api/auth/verify
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "token": "your-jwt-token-here"
}
```

**Response (Valid Token):**
```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "user": {
    "id": "user_id",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "userType": "COMMON",
    "isActive": true
  },
  "token": "jwt_token_here",
  "expiresAt": "2024-01-02T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Response (Invalid/Expired Token):**
```json
{
  "error": "Token expired"
}
```

### Protected Routes
All cart and product APIs require authentication. Include the JWT token in the Authorization header:
```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

### Frontend Token Validation

Use the `useAuthToken` hook to validate tokens in your components:

```typescript
import { useAuthToken } from '@/hooks/useAuthToken';

function MyComponent() {
  const { validateToken, isValidating } = useAuthToken();

  const checkToken = async () => {
    const result = await validateToken();
    
    if (result.isValid) {
      console.log('Token is valid, user:', result.user);
    } else {
      console.log('Token is invalid:', result.error);
      // Token will be automatically removed from storage
    }
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={checkToken} disabled={isValidating}>
      {isValidating ? 'Validating...' : 'Check Token'}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Security Features
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- **JWT Expiration**: 24-hour token expiration
- **Input Validation**: Email format and password length validation
- **Error Handling**: Generic error messages to prevent information leakage
- **Token Verification**: Comprehensive JWT validation including expiration and user status checks
- **Auto-cleanup**: Invalid/expired tokens are automatically removed from storage

## 🛒 Cart Architecture: Redux + Cookies (SSR Compatible)

This project uses **Redux** (with [next-redux-wrapper](https://github.com/kirill-konshin/next-redux-wrapper)) and **cookies** to manage the shopping cart, ensuring full SSR (Server-Side Rendering) compatibility and persistence across sessions.

### How It Works
- **Redux** manages the cart state globally across your app.
- **Cart state is persisted in cookies** (`qrs_cart`) so it survives page reloads, browser restarts, and is available for SSR.
- On the server, the cart can be hydrated from cookies for SSR pages.
- On the client, the cart is kept in sync with cookies automatically.

### Why This Approach?
- **SSR/SEO:** Cart contents are available on first render, even for bots/crawlers.
- **Persistence:** Cart survives browser restarts and is available across tabs.
- **Scalability:** Easy to extend for authenticated users (e.g., sync with database).

### Usage in Components
- Use `useSelector` from `react-redux` to access cart state:
  ```ts
  import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
  import { AppState } from '@/lib/store';
  const cartItems = useSelector((state: AppState) => state.cart.items);
  ```
- Use `useDispatch` to add, update, or remove items:
  ```ts
  import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
  import { addItem, updateItemQuantity, removeItem, clearCart } from '@/lib/store';
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  dispatch(addItem({ ... }));
  ```

### SSR and Hydration
- The cart is available on both server and client thanks to cookies and next-redux-wrapper.
- No need for localStorage/sessionStorage hacks.

### Testing
- Tests use a Redux provider and can dispatch cart actions directly.
- See `src/test/utils/renderWithIntl.tsx` for the test setup.

### Migration Notes
- The old cart context/sessionStorage logic has been fully replaced.
- All cart operations are now Redux actions/selectors.

## 🚀 Deployment

The application is deployed to Vercel for production. **No Dockerfile is needed for production or development.**

### Local Development with Docker Compose
- The `nextjs` service in `docker-compose.yml` uses the official `node:18-alpine` image.
- Your code is mounted as a volume, and the container runs `npm install` and `npm run dev` for hot-reload.
- This setup is for local development only.

## 📄 License

This project is created for the QRS Shopping Cart Challenge.

## Database Setup (PostgreSQL via Docker)

This project uses Docker to run PostgreSQL with persistent storage. Follow these steps to set up, reset, and seed your database:

### 1. Start PostgreSQL with Docker

```
npm run docker:up
```

This will start the PostgreSQL container defined in `docker-compose.yml` and create a persistent volume (`qrs_postgres_data`).

### 2. Generate Prisma Client

```
npm run db:generate
```

### 3. Push the Prisma Schema to the Database

```
npm run db:push
```

### 4. Seed the Database (Test Users & Sample Data)

```
npm run db:seed
```

This will create:
- Sample banners, categories, and products
- Two test users:
  - Common user: `common@example.com` / `password123`
  - VIP user: `vip@example.com` / `password123`

### 5. Open Prisma Studio (Optional)

```
npm run db:studio
```

This opens a web UI at http://localhost:5555 to inspect and edit your database.

### Resetting the Database

To reset the database (wipe all data and start fresh):

1. **Stop the database:**
   ```sh
   npm run docker:down
   ```
2. **Remove the Docker volume:**
   ```sh
   docker volume rm qrs_postgres_data
   ```
3. **Start the database again:**
   ```sh
   npm run docker:up
   ```
4. **Repeat steps 2–4 above** (generate, push, seed).

---

## Notes
- The database connection details are configured in your `.env` file.
- Only Docker is used for PostgreSQL; all other services run locally.
- If you change the Prisma schema, always re-run `npm run db:generate` and `npm run db:push`.

## Architecture & Design Decisions

This project is built with a focus on simplicity, maintainability, and a good user experience. Here are the main points about how it is structured and why:

- **Next.js**: The app uses Next.js for both frontend and backend. Pages are server-rendered for better SEO and fast loading. API routes are used for backend logic (like checkout and authentication).

- **Prisma ORM**: Prisma is used to talk to the PostgreSQL database. It makes database queries easy and safe, and helps keep the code clean.

- **PostgreSQL with Docker**: The database runs in a Docker container. This makes it easy to set up and reset the database for development. You don’t need to install Postgres on your computer.

- **Cart Logic**: The cart is stored in the browser’s sessionStorage, so it stays even if you refresh the page. The cart logic is in a custom React hook, making it easy to use in any component.

- **Promotion Logic**: All discount and promotion calculations are done in a single utility function. This makes it easy to test and update the rules. The logic always tries to give the customer the best deal, and VIP users can choose which discount to use.

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens are used for login. User info and tokens are stored in localStorage. The app supports both common and VIP users.
  - JWT tokens expire in 24 hours for security.
- **Order History**: Orders are saved in the database with the promotion used and the final price. The order history page shows all details, including the discount applied.

- **Testing**: The promotion logic is covered by unit tests to make sure all scenarios work as expected.

- **Why these choices?**
  - Next.js and Prisma are popular, well-supported, and easy to use.
  - Docker makes development setup simple for everyone.
  - Keeping business logic (like promotions) in one place makes the app easier to maintain and test.


## Improvements (Planned or Possible)

- **Abandoned Cart Sync**: The database already supports tracking abandoned carts. A future improvement is to implement hybrid cart logic: when a user logs in or out, the cart in sessionStorage will be synced with the database. This way, users can keep their cart across devices or after logging in.
- More advanced admin features, order status tracking, and better error handling can be added as needed.
